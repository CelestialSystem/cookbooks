The Japanese test is maintained by Megumi Sawada (sawada@lansa.jp) of LANSA Japan.

The source code is in this directory.
It requires a Japanese language PC and Japanese VL IDE install to build and test otherwise corruption occurs in the test case. (Hence why its maintained by LANSA Japan)

Import the LANSA export into your partition and build the server module and table.

Then import the sql into the table.

The MSI is constructed using the deployment tool application.
