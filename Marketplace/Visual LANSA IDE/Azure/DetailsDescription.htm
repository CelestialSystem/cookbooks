<h2>Advanced development made simple</h2>
<p>LANSA provides the only Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you will ever need for rapid application development of Mobile, Web, Windows, Linux and IBM i (System i, iSeries and AS/400) applications.
<p>With technology changing at an incredible rate and developers spending a lot of time keeping up-to-date, it makes good business sense to invest in the one agile development tool that is future-proof. LANSA's rapid application development tools are open and flexible, enabling you to write code that runs free of the underlying operating system, database technology or display style.</p>
<p>The Visual LANSA Framework allows developers to assemble commercial grade software rapidly with minimal coding, generating high quality Windows and Web applications with a consistent appearance and behavior. The application and user interface design are prototyped at the same time and use the same design for both Windows and Web. The learning curve is extremely short, productivity is high and the applications are world class – it’s like having an experienced mentor sitting next to your developers.</p>
